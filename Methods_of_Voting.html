    <h2><a href="https://www.mtholyoke.edu/acad/polit/damy/BeginnningReading/plurality.htm#smp" target="_blank"><strong>Single-Member District Plurality Voting (aka 'First-Past-the-Post (FPTP)' Voting)</strong></a></h2>

      <p>FPTP involves a single candidate within a electoral district winning the most amount of votes, even if it is not an absolute majority (at least 50% + 1) of all voting constituents. This is the simplest form of voting utilized in local, statewide, and national elections in various countries around the world, such as the United States (U.S.), Canada, and the United Kingdom (U.K.), although each of these countries have a number of jurisdictions that utilize other forms of voting in certain elections.</p>

      <p>An alternative version of FPTP is '<a href="https://www.mtholyoke.edu/acad/polit/damy/BeginnningReading/plurality.htm#atlarge" target="_blank"><strong>At-Large Voting</strong></a>,' which involves multiple candidates running on one ballot in a single multi-member district. Voters are allowed to fill in as much or as little of the ballot as they want with the only limit being the total amount of seats that needs to be filled. Votes are then tallied for each candidate and the candidates with highest number of votes win those seats.</p>

    <h2><a href="https://www.mtholyoke.edu/acad/polit/damy/BeginnningReading/plurality.htm#irv" target="_blank"><strong>Instant Runoff Voting (IRV) (aka 'Alternative Voting (AV)')</strong></a></h2>

      <p>IRV involves voters ranking their most prefered candidates (with '1' being their first preference, '2' being their second, and so on) on a ballot in as many or as few marked boxes as they like. Afterwards, votes are tallied for everyone's first preferences and if no candidate has reach an absolute majority (see FPTP above) of votes, the candidate with the least amount of votes is eliminated and all of his or her votes are then transferred to their next [available] preference listed on the ballot. This process repeats until the candidate receives an absolute majority of votes and is declared the elected winner.</p>

      <p>An alternative, but less-used, version of the IRV is the '<a href="https://www.mtholyoke.edu/acad/polit/damy/BeginnningReading/plurality.htm#tworound" target="_blank"><strong>Two-Round Runoff System</strong></a>,' which involves a runoff election that involves exactly two candidates that received the most amount of votes, but not an absolute majority to win the first round. Hence, both candidates would seek support between the two rounds of election to win votes from their constituents.</p> 

    <h2><a href="https://www.mtholyoke.edu/acad/polit/damy/BeginnningReading/PRsystems.htm#party" target="_blank"><strong>Party-List Proportional Representation Voting (Open/Closed List)</strong></a></h2>
      
      <p>Party-List Proportional Representation involves voters for their prefered political parties. Prior to the election, a select list of candidates from each party would be added to the ballot based on the number of [available] seats in each district. There are two main types of list systems: 'closed-party list' and 'open-party list':</p> 

        <ol>
          <li id="cllt">In a '<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Closed_list" target="_blank"><strong>closed-party list</strong></a>,' the ballot would include:</li> 
            <ul>
              <li>every registered political parties that are running candidates in the election;</li> 
              <li>each registered parties' pre-selected lists of respective candidates that would be arranged in order of preference of who they want in the legislature (usually the leader of each national or local party on the ballot (depending on what type of election that the ballot is being used for) is listed first if he or she is running in that district)</li>
              <li>Voters would only mark down the box of one political party that they prefered the most and depending on their position on the list, each candidate on the ballot may or may not be assigned a seat based on the results of the election.</li>
              <li>For example, if a party wins 9 seats in a 15-member district, then the top nine candidates on that respective list would be elected in that district. The remaining 6 seats would be assigned to the other parties, if they've received enough votes to be assigned at least one seat on the ballot.</li>
            </ul>

          <li id="oplt">In an '<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_list" target="_blank"><strong>open-party list</strong></a>,' the ballot would include: </li>
            <ul>
              <li>every registered political parties that are running candidates in the election;</li> 
              <li>checkboxes for each candidate below the names of their respective party</li>
              <li>Voters would only mark down the box of a particular candidate, which would also count as a vote for that candidate's respective political party. If a political party wins at least 1 or 2 seats based on the election results, the seat(s) would then be allocated to the party's respective candidate(s) with the most amount of votes received on the ballot.</li>
              <li>There are different variants of open-list voting, based on different variables ranging from the use of quotas to determining how preferences are arranged on a list and how votes are distributed based on the election results.</li>
            </ul> 
        </ol>

      <p>Regardless of which list is used, if it's a national election for the [federal] legislature, the election results of each district would be added together for the final number of seats for each political party in the legislature.</p>

      <p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Party-list_proportional_representation" target="_blank">two most common methods</a> for seat allocations are:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>The <strong><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Highest_averages_method" target="_blank">highest average methods</a></strong>: <strong><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/D%27Hondt_method" target="_blank">D'Hondt method</a></strong> (if you're still confused, a video explanation is <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6CU3F3ToIIg" target="_blank">here</a>) and <strong><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sainte-Lagu%C3%AB_method" target="_blank">Sainte-LaguÃ« method</a></strong>.</li>

          <li>The <strong><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Largest_remainder_method" target="_blank">largest remainder (LR) methods</a></strong>, including the <strong>Hamilton method</strong>.</li>

          <li>Each country that utilize either of these methods have different variations on how to apply them, based on certain variables such as <strong><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Election_threshold" target="_blank">electoral threshold</a></strong> (10%, at most) and quotas. This would include utilizing a different formula to achieve similar results.</li>
        </ul>


    <h2><a href="https://www.mtholyoke.edu/acad/polit/damy/BeginnningReading/PRsystems.htm#MMP" target="_blank"><strong>Mixed-Member Proportional (MMP) Representation Vote</strong></a></h2>
      
      <p>MMP is a combination of both a 'plurality/majority system' of voting (mainly FPTP) and 'party-list proportional representation system' of voting, with a set number of seats in a local/national legislature for both voting systems.</p>

      <p>For countries that utilize MMP, their ballots would consist of the following:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>one side would consists of <strong>a list of candidates from their respective districts</strong>; each voter would mark only their most preferred candidate and the candidate with a plurality or a majority (depending on the 'plurality/majority system' of voting) of votes win the seat in his or her district.</li>
          <li>the other side would consists of either an <a href="#oplt">open-party list</a> or <a href="#cllt">closed-party list</a> (mainly the latter).</li>
        </ul>
