      <p><strong>FPTP</strong> involves a single candidate within a electoral district winning the most amount of votes, even if it is not an absolute majority (at least 50% + 1) of all voting constituents. This is the simplest form of voting utilized in local, statewide, and national elections in various countries around the world, such as the United States (U.S.), Canada, and the United Kingdom (U.K.), although each of these countries have a number of jurisdictions that utilize other forms of voting in certain elections.</p>

      <p>An alternative version of FPTP is '<a href="https://www.mtholyoke.edu/acad/polit/damy/BeginnningReading/plurality.htm#atlarge" target="_blank"><strong>At-Large Voting</strong></a>,' which involves multiple candidates running on one ballot in a single multi-member district. Voters are allowed to fill in as much or as little of the ballot as they want with the only limit being the total amount of seats that needs to be filled. Votes are then tallied for each candidate and the candidates with highest number of votes win those seats.</p>



    <h2 id="irv"><a href="https://www.mtholyoke.edu/acad/polit/damy/BeginnningReading/plurality.htm#irv" target="_blank"><strong>Instant Runoff Voting (IRV) (aka 'Alternative Voting (AV)')</strong></a></h2>

      <p><strong>IRV</strong> involves voters ranking their most prefered candidates (with '1' being their first preference, '2' being their second, and so on) on a ballot in as many or as few marked boxes as they like. Afterwards, votes are tallied for everyone's first preferences and if no candidate has reach an absolute majority (see FPTP above) of votes, the candidate with the least amount of votes is eliminated and all of his or her votes are then transferred to their next [available] preference listed on the ballot. This process repeats until the candidate receives an absolute majority of votes and is declared the elected winner.</p>

      <p>An alternative, but less-used, version of the IRV is the '<a href="https://www.mtholyoke.edu/acad/polit/damy/BeginnningReading/plurality.htm#tworound" target="_blank"><strong>Two-Round Runoff System</strong></a>,' which involves a runoff election that involves exactly two candidates that received the most amount of votes, but not an absolute majority to win the first round. Hence, both candidates would seek support between the two rounds of election to win votes from their constituents.</p> 

    <h2><a href="https://www.mtholyoke.edu/acad/polit/damy/BeginnningReading/PRsystems.htm#party" target="_blank"><strong>Party-List Proportional Representation Voting (Open/Closed List)</strong></a></h2>
      
      <p><strong>Party-List Proportional Representation</strong> involves voters for their prefered political parties. Prior to the election, a select list of candidates from each party would be added to the ballot based on the number of [available] seats in each district. There are two main types of list systems: 'closed-party list' and 'open-party list':</p> 

        <ol>
          <li id="cllt">In a '<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Closed_list" target="_blank"><strong>closed-party list</strong></a>,' the ballot would include:</li> 
            <ul>
              <li>every registered political parties that are running candidates in the election;</li> 

              <li>each registered parties' pre-selected lists of respective candidates that would be arranged in order of preference of who they want in the legislature (usually the leader of each national or local party on the ballot (depending on what type of election that the ballot is being used for) is listed first if he or she is running in that district).</li>

              <li>Voters would only mark down the box of one political party that they prefered the most and depending on their position on the list, each candidate on the ballot may or may not be assigned a seat based on the results of the election.</li>

              <li>For example, if a party wins 9 seats in a 15-member district, then the top nine candidates on that respective list would be elected in that district. The remaining 6 seats would be assigned to the other parties, if they've received enough votes to be assigned at least one seat on the ballot.</li>
            </ul>

          <li id="oplt">In an '<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_list" target="_blank"><strong>open-party list</strong></a>,' the ballot would include: </li>
            <ul>
              <li>every registered political parties that are running candidates in the election;</li> 

              <li>checkboxes for each candidate below the names of their respective party</li>

              <li>Voters would only mark down the box of a particular candidate, which would also count as a vote for that candidate's respective political party. If a political party wins at least 1 or 2 seats based on the election results, the seat(s) would then be allocated to the party's respective candidate(s) with the most amount of votes received on the ballot.</li>

              <li>There are different variants of open-list voting, based on different variables ranging from the use of quotas to determining how preferences are arranged on a list and how votes are distributed based on the election results.</li>
            </ul> 
        </ol>

      <p>Regardless of which list is used, if it's a national election for the [federal] legislature, the election results of each district would be added together for the final number of seats for each political party in the legislature.</p>

      <p id="seal">The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Party-list_proportional_representation" target="_blank">two most common methods</a> for seat allocations are:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>The <strong><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Highest_averages_method" target="_blank">highest average methods</a></strong>: <strong><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/D%27Hondt_method" target="_blank">D'Hondt method</a></strong> (if you're still confused, a video explanation is <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6CU3F3ToIIg" target="_blank">here</a>) and <strong><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sainte-Lagu%C3%AB_method" target="_blank">Sainte-LaguÃ« method</a></strong>.</li>

          <li>The <strong><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Largest_remainder_method" target="_blank">largest remainder (LR) methods</a></strong>, including the <strong>Hamilton method</strong>.</li>

          <li>Each country that utilize either of these methods have different variations on how to apply them, based on certain variables such as <strong><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Election_threshold" target="_blank">electoral threshold</a></strong> (10%, at most) and quotas. This could include utilizing a different formula to achieve similar results.</li>
        </ul>


    <h2><a href="https://www.mtholyoke.edu/acad/polit/damy/BeginnningReading/PRsystems.htm#MMP" target="_blank"><strong>Mixed-Member Proportional (MMP) Representation Vote</strong></a></h2>
      
      <p><strong>MMP</strong> is a combination of both a 'plurality/majority system' of voting (mainly FPTP) and 'party-list proportional representation system' of voting (mainly a 'closed-party list' system), with a set number of seats in a local/national legislature for both voting systems.</p>

      <p>For countries that utilize MMP, their ballots would consist of the following:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>one side would consists of <strong>a list of candidates from their respective districts</strong>; each voter would mark only their most preferred candidate and the candidate with a plurality or a majority (depending on the 'plurality/majority system' of voting) of votes win the seat in his or her district.</li>

          <li>the other side would consists of either an <a href="#oplt">open-party list</a> or <a href="#cllt">closed-party list</a> of political parties and their respective candidates.</li>

          <li>Due to the dual nature of MMP, voters would have two votes to cast: 1 for a district candidate and 1 for a party and/or specific members of that party. Afterwards, each vote made on the ballot would be counted separately from each other. While the votes for a particular candidate would be counted for each candidate on the list in that district only, the other set of votes would be counted towards the overall percentage of [national] votes. Those latter votes would then be calculated under one of two sets of methods for seat allocation (listed <a href="#seal">above</a>).</li>
        </ul>

      <p>Other features that were used for 'party-list proportional representation' (i.e.,quotas, formulas to determine how the seats are allocated based on cumulative votes, and electoral thresholds) are also used for MMP (each country that utilized MMP also has a minimum requirement of seats that a political party needs to win directly (e.g., FPTP) in case it doesn't make the overall [national] threshold).</p>

      <p>An aspect that is apparently exclusive to the MMP are <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overhang_seat" target="_blank">overhang seats</a>, which occurs when a political party wins more seats than it is entitled to, based on the proportionality of votes that it accumulated during election day. Only <a href="http://www.idea.int/esd/type.cfm?electoralSystem=MMP" target="_blank">9 known countries</a> utilizes MMP or a variation of it.</p>

    <h2><a href="https://www.mtholyoke.edu/acad/polit/damy/BeginnningReading/PRsystems.htm#stv" target="_blank"><strong>Single-Transferrable Vote (STV)</strong></a></h2>
      
      <p><strong>STV</strong> is the only known 'proportional-representation system' that doesn't consider a candidate's [political] party affiliation as a final factor when determining the allocation of seats after the election. Just like the other PR systems, STV utilize multi-constiuent districts (where more than one candidate could contest and represent any particular district).</p>

      <p>Just like <a href="#irv">IRV</a>, STV involves voters ranking their candidates on the ballot in order of preference without the need to mark every checkbox on the list.</p>

      <p>The number of votes that each candidate needs to acquire in order to be elected depends on two main factors: (1) the <strong>valid number of votes that were cast</strong> and (2) the <strong>number of seats that need to be filled in each particular district</strong>. Both factors are added into one of two different formulas to set the quota: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Droop_quota" target="_blank"><strong>Droop</strong> quota</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hare_quota" target="_blank"><strong>Hare</strong> quota</a></p>

      <p>When it comes to determining who will be elected to each seat in the district, each ballots' first preference votes would be counted. Afterwards, the process is as follows:</p>

        <ol>
          <li>If a vote for a candidate reached or exceeded the quota, then the candidate is then declared elected.</li>
          
          <li>Any surplus votes from the elected candidate would be redistributed to their next available choice. There are different methods for allocating surplus votes (listed <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Counting_single_transferable_votes#Surplus_allocation" target="_blank">here</a>).</li>

          <li>If there are no other candidates who've reached the quota, then the candidate with the fewest votes is eliminated and have his or her votes transferred to their next available choice. Depending on the circumstnces (e.g., if the transferred votes are not enough to change the position of the remaining candidates), multiple candidates with the fewest votes could be eliminated simultaneously in one round (see more about this process <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Counting_single_transferable_votes#Distribution_of_excluded_candidate_preferences" target="_blank">here</a>).</li>

          <li>Steps 1 through 3 are repeated until every seat is filled or there are as many seats left as the remaining candidates. In the latter case, even if the remaining candidates have fewer votes than the [minimum] quota, they could end up elected as long as their final preference votes are closer to the quota than their nearest competitor(s).</li>
        </ol>
