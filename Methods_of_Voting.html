    <h2>First-Past-the-Post (FPTP) Vote (aka 'Winner-Takes-All' system) </h2>
      <p>As the name suggests, FPTP involves a single candidate within a electoral district winning the most amount of votes, even if it is not an absolute majority (at least 50% + 1) of all voting constituents. This is the simplest form of voting utilized in local, statewide, and national elections in various countries around the world, such as the United States (U.S.), Canada, and the United Kingdom (U.K.), although each of these countries have a number of jurisdictions that utilize other forms of voting in certain elections. FPTP is also used as part of other methods of voting, such as AV and MMP. </p>
