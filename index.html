  <h2><a href="Systems_of_Government.html">Systems of Government</a></h2>
    <p>In this article page, you would learn about the different government systems, what they are all about, and which nations have which system. These government systems would include <strong>two sets of competing forms of governments</strong> (both of which any country could be characterized as): <strong>Parliamentary</strong> system vs. <strong>Presidential</strong> system and <strong>[Constitutional or Absolute] Monarchy</strong> vs. <strong>Republic</strong> (the latter also includes <em>'one-party states'</em>).</p>

  <h2><a href="Unitary_states_vs._Federations">Unitary states vs. Federations</a></h2>
    <p>Aside from the different forms of governments, there are also different structures on how powers are delegated within each country's government. In this page, we will focus on the <strong>two main structures of government</strong>: <strong>Unitary states</strong> (more power to the central government) vs. <strong>Federations</strong> (power is [mostly] divided between the country's central government and the government of each of its 'self-governing states').</p>

  <h2><a href="Methods_of_Voting.html">Methods of Voting</a></h2>
    <p>In this page, we will look at 5 different methods that most countries utilized to elect their candidates into government (legislatures): '<strong>First Past the Post (FPTP)</strong>,' '<strong>Alternative Vote</strong>' <strong>(aka 'Instant-Runoff Voting')</strong>, '<strong>Proportional Representation (PR) Party List</strong>' system, '<strong>Single-Transferrable Vote (STV)</strong>' (which is part of the PR system), and '<strong>Mixed-Member Proportional Representation (MMPR)</strong>.'</p>
