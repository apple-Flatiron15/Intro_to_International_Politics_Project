    <h2>Parliamentary vs. Presidential</h2>
        <h3>Parliamentary System</h3>
            <p>A Parliamentary System consists of the following concepts: </p>
            <ul>
              <li>The Executive branch consists of a 'head of state' (e.g., President), a 'head of government' (e.g., 'Prime Minister,' 'Chancellor'), and members of the latter's cabinet who are members of the governing party/coalition parties. The head of state is often a different individual than the 'head of government'  with the latter usually holding more power than the former despite being in a lower position of power/status. A head of government is often a member, as well as the leader of the largest/governing party in the legislative body (e.g., 'Parliament'; 'lower house' if the legislature is "bicarmel").</li>
              <li>Depending on the country, the head of government could be [either] appointed/nominated by the head of state and/or elected with or without the approval of either the electorate or the respective legislature.</li>
              <li>Most heads of state in a parliamentary system of government functions as a cermonial/symbolic figure with any approved bills becoming law and promulgated with or without the approval of the head of state after a certain period of time. There are, however, certain functions that certain heads of state could perform, such as providing pardons to specific individuals, command the armed forces of their respective country, and being able to check the constitutionality of a bill before signing it into law (specifics vary from country to country).</li>
            </ul>
              
            <p>The Legislature (either unicarmel ("one house") or bicarmel ("two houses")) could consists of:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>a '<strong>lower house</strong> (e.g., 'House of Commons')' (or a single 'house' if unicarmel) that is directly elected by the electorate. The 'lower house' is the most dominant chamber of the legislature with most, if not all, bills coming from this house and the ability to pass bills without the full consent of the upper house after a certain period of time (this latter procedure is not available in all countries with a parliamentary system and specifics for this procedure varies from country to country).</li>
                <li>a '<strong>upper house</strong> (e.g., 'Senate')' that usually have its members appointed or elected by a different method than the lower house. The 'upper house,' despite being in a higher position of government, has less power than the 'lower house' and mainly serve as a 'check-and-balance' to the more dominant 'lower house.' Hence, aside from being able to delay a bill from being brought to the floor for a vote, vetoing or defeating a bill allows the 'upper house' to send a message to its lower counterpart to either amend the bill or scrap it entirely (again, this procedure is not available in all countries with a parliamentary system and specifics for this procedure varies from country to country). Of course, this ability is not foolproof and could be countered by the 'lower house' simply passing the bill again, amended or not.</li>
              </ul>

            <ul>
              <li>The 'lower house' is also the one that determines the legitimacy of the Executive branch and holds it accountable by being able to vote in a new head of government if/when it has the votes to do so through various methods, particularly through a '<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motion_of_no_confidence" target="_blank">motion of no confidence</a>' in which a majority of the elected house deems a member of the government (i.e., the head of government or [a] member(s) of his/her cabinet) unfit to fit his/her current position. In this case or by voluntary resignation of the said individual, a member of either the governing party or another party within the governing coalition could be voted in as the new head of government with a 'majority vote.' The same circumstances could apply to any member of the cabinet.</li>

              <li>In a parliamentary system, elections could be called for when either: (1) the head of government calls for an election on a specific date within the constitutional limit for an election or (2) the legislature votes against the government by the motion listed above or by defeating a appropriation (or budget) bill proposed by the government. Hence, the latter could force an earlier election. In either case, the legislature would "dissolve" by the order of a head of state who is not up for election at the same time as the rest of the executive branch. Specifics for "dissolving" the legislature varies from country to country, although the two cases listed above are the most common causes of "dissolution."</li>

              <li>Constitutional Monarchies utilize a parliamentary system with their head of state being a monarch instead of an elected presidential figure. In that case, a representative of that monarch could make the official announcement on the "dissolution" of the legislature on his/her behalf.</li>

              <li>Either way, after the "dissolution" of the legislature, the election campaign begins and the legislature would not reconvene until after a set period of time when the votes are all tallied and a government or a government coalition is officially formed (there are some instances in which the winning party is unable to either win a majority of seats in the election or form a coalition with any other parties that've won seats afterwards; hence, a party that wish to form a government without anyone else would end up forming a "Minority Government," in which the 'opposition parties' and their [respective] members outnumbers the governing party.</li>
          </ul>

          </ul>



    <h2>Monarchy vs. Republic</h2>
      <h3>Monarchy</h3>
        <p>There are two forms of Monarchy:</p>
            <h4>Absolute Monarchy</h4>
              <ul>  
                <li>An Absolute Monarchy is a form of government that consists of a ruler who wields more executive political power/influence over their people than a constitutional monarchy, as part of their 'divine right to rule.' Their legislatures tend to be weaker in an absolute monarchy than any other forms of government in the world, as their [executive] leader tends to be in charge of any laws that he wants to be passed and enforced.</li>
                <li>Originally popular in the past, the number of absolute monarchies have shrunk considerably as a result of revolutions, cultural uprisings, and the growth of technology that greatly weakened their influences. Today, most absolute monarchies have transitioned into constitutional monarchies as a way of modernizing their standards of governance without throwing away all of their political (and historical) traditions.</li>
              </ul>

            <h4>Constitutional Monarchy</h4>
              <ul>
                <li>A Constitutional Monarchy is a form of government that consists of a monarch (king, queen, etc.) who serves as the [main] head of state, as well as the symbol [of unity] of one's own country. Most constitutional monarchies are selected through a process of hereditary succession (the process in which a member of the royal family is crowned ruler of their respective nation upon the death or abdication of the current monarch), although there are a few that have their monarchs selected by other political and/or religious institutions. Their powers, as a monarch, are limited by their country's constitution and statutes, and varies from country to country.</li>
              </ul>

            <p>There are two types of constitutional monarchs:</p>
                <h4>Ceremonial Monarchs</h4>
                  <ul>
                    <li>Ceremonial Monarchs are those who, in most circumstances, wield little political power/influence as compared to a head of government (e.g., prime minister). Hence, in most (if not all) cases, any acts passed by the country's legislature is automatically approved (and promulgated) into law (aka 'Royal Assent') by the ceremonial monarch. Most of the world's constitutional monarchies consists of ceremonial monarchs.</li>
                  </ul>

                <h4>Executive Monarchs</h4>
                  <ul>
                    <li>Executive Monarchs are those who wield considerable political power and influence alongside the rest of the governmental instiutions, whether it's passing or vetoing laws (rather than just having them automatically approved and promulgated), or serving as the leader of the country's armed forces.</li>
                  </ul>

      <h3>Republic</h3>
      <p>A Republic is a form of government that doesn't have a monarch (or any other type of royalty) as their head of state/government and involves elected officials and the citizens who've voted for them.</p>

      <p>There are three forms of a Republic:</p>
          <ol>
            <li>Parliamentary Republic - a republican-based country/territory/jurisdiction that utilizes a parliamentary system of government.</li>
            <li>Presidential Republic - a republican-based country/territory/jurisdiction that utilizes a presidential system of government.</li>
            <li>Single-Party State</li>
          </ol>
