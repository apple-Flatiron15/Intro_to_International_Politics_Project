<h1>The Differents Forms of Government</h1>
</header>

<section>
<h2>Parliamentary vs. Presidential</h2>
<p></p>
<h2>Monarchy vs. Republic</h2>
<h3>Monarchy</h3>
<p>There are two forms of Monarchy:
    <ol>
        <li>Absolute Monarchy</li>
          <p>An Absolute Monarchy is a form of government that consists of a ruler who wields more executive political power/influence over their people than a constitutional monarchy, as part of their 'divine right to rule.' Their legislatures tend to be weaker in an absolute monarchy than any other forms of government in the world, as their [executive] leader tends to be in charge of any laws that he wants to be passed and enforced.</p>
          <p>Originally popular in the past, the number of absolute monarchies have shrunk considerably as a result of revolutions, cultural uprisings, and the growth of technology that greatly weakened their influences. Today, most absolute monarchies have transitioned into constitutional monarchies as a way of modernizing their standards of governance without throwing away all of their political (and historical) traditions.</p>

        <li>Constitutional Monarchy</li>
          <p>A Constitutional Monarchy is a form of government that consists of a monarch (king, queen, etc.) who serves as the [main] head of state, as well as the symbol [of unity] of one's own country. Most constitutional monarchies are selected through a process of hereditary succession, although there are a few that have their monarchs selected by other political and/or religious institutions. Their powers, as a monarch, are limited by their country's constitution and statutes, and varies from country to country.</p>
          <p> There are two types of constitutional monarchs:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Ceremonial Monarchs</li>
                <p>Ceremonial Monarchs are those who, in most circumstances, wield little political power/influence as compared to a head of government (e.g., prime minister). Hence, in most (if not all) cases, any acts passed by the country's legislature is automatically approved (and promulgated) into law (aka 'Royal Assent') by the ceremonial monarch. Most of the world's constitutional monarchies consists of ceremonial monarchs.</p>
              <li>Executive Monarchs</li>
                <p>Executive Monarchs are those who wield considerable political power and influence alongside the rest of the governmental instiutions, whether it's passing or vetoing laws (rather than just having them automatically approved and promulgated), or serving as the leader of the country's armed forces.</p>
            </ul>
      </ol>
</p>

<h3>Republic</h3>
<p>A Republic is a form of government that doesn't have a monarch (or any other type of royalty) as their head of state/government and involves elected officials and the citizens who've voted for them.</p>
<p>There are three forms of a Republic:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Parliamentary Republic</li>
        <p>A Parliamentary Republic is a form of government where the legislature determines the legitimacy of the executive branch and holds it accountable by being able to vote in a new head of government (e.g., 'Prime Minister,' 'Chancellor') if/when it has the votes to do so through a '<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motion_of_no_confidence" target="_blank">motion of no confidence</a>.' In this case, a member of either the governing party or another party (often the former) could be voted in as the new head of government with a 'majority vote' </p>
        <p>A head of state (e.g., President) is often a different individual than the head of government with the latter usually holding more power than the former despite being in a lower position of power/status. A head of government is usually a member of the legislature (e.g., 'Parliament') and is often the leader of the largest/governing party in the legislative body.</p>
      <li>Presidential Republic</li>
        <p></p>
      <li>Single-Party State</li>
        <p></p>
    </ol>
