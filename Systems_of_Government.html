              <li>Consists of a 'head of state' (e.g., President), a 'head of government' (e.g., 'Prime Minister,' 'Chancellor'), and members of the latter's cabinet who are members of the governing party/coalition parties.</li>

              <li>Depending on the country, the head of government could be [either] appointed or nominated by the head of state and/or elected with or without the approval of their respective legislature.</li>

              <li>The head of state is often a different individual than the 'head of government'  with the latter usually holding more power than the former despite being in a lower position of the political hierarchy. A head of government is often a member, as well as the leader of the largest/governing party in the legislative body (e.g., 'Parliament'; 'lower house' if the legislature is "bicarmel").</li>

              <li>Depending on each particular country, certain (if not, all) cabinet members of the government (e.g., 'Prime Minister,' 'Deputy Prime Minister,' etc.) may or may not have to resign their seat(s) in the legislature in order to take up their position in the executive branch. Their replacements may either be elected or appointed (depending on the country, once again, and/or whether it's either a type of monarchy or republic) at a latter date. </li>

              <li>The cabinet of each president consists of cabinet ministers and department executives, who are first nominated by the president and [in most cases,] receive legislative approval from a certain 'house' of the legislature (or the 'main' legislature, if unicarmel) on a particular date. Any member of the president's cabinet who is currently a member of the legislature must resign to take up his or her position in the cabinet. The vacant spot in the legislature may be appointed by that state's/region's/province's [head]executive to temporarily fill the space until a election is called to permanently fill it in.</li>

          <td>Legislative Branch</td>
          <td>
            <ul>
              <li>Could be either <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unicameralism" target="_blank">unicamel</a> or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bicameralism" target="_blank">bicamel</a>.</li>

              <li>The '<strong>lower house</strong> (e.g., 'House of Commons')' (or a single 'house' if unicarmel) is always directly elected by the electorate. The 'lower house' is the most dominant chamber of the legislature with most, if not all, bills coming from this house and the ability to pass bills without the full consent of the upper house after a certain period of time (this latter procedure is not available in all countries with a parliamentary system and specifics for this procedure varies from country to country).</li>

              <ul>
                <li>The 'lower house' is also the one that determines the legitimacy of the Executive branch and holds it accountable by being able to vote in a new head of government if/when it has the votes to do so through various methods, particularly through a '<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motion_of_no_confidence" target="_blank">motion of no confidence</a>' in which a majority of the elected house deems a member of the government (i.e., the head of government or [a] member(s) of his/her cabinet) unfit to fit his/her current position. In this case or by the voluntary resignation of the said individual, a member of either the governing party or another party within the governing coalition could be voted in as the new head of government with a 'majority vote.' The same circumstances could apply to any member of the cabinet.</li>
              </ul>

              <li>The'<strong>upper house</strong> (e.g., 'Senate')' usually have its members either appointed or elected by a different method than the lower house. The 'upper house,' despite being in a higher position of government, has less power than the 'lower house' and mainly serve as a 'check-and-balance' to the more dominant 'lower house.' </li>

              <ul>
                <li>Hence, aside from being able to delay a bill from being brought to the floor for a vote, vetoing or defeating a bill allows the 'upper house' to send a message to its lower counterpart to either amend the bill or scrap it entirely (again, this procedure is not available in all countries with a parliamentary system and specifics for this procedure varies from country to country). Of course, this ability is not foolproof and could be countered by the 'lower house' simply passing the bill again, amended or not.</li>

                <li>However, there are a few countries whose upper house in the legislature shares nearly equal power alongside their lower-house counterparts (similar to the ones in the 'Presidential System').</li>
              </ul>

              <li>The '<strong>lower house</strong> (e.g., 'House of Representatives')' (or a single 'house' if unicarmel) is the co-equal chamber of the legislature along side the 'upper house' and does not dominate the legislative process during its time in session and shares responsibility with introducing bills from either chamber.</li>

              <li>The '<strong>upper house</strong> (e.g., 'Senate'),' unlike its counterpart in the parliamentary system, does not simply function as a limited-power advisory form of a legislative body. Instead, the Senate has the ability to both introduce and pass/defeat/block bills that originates from either chamber.</li>

              <li>In addition to what's mentioned above, the two houses could also be tasked with certain responsibilities that are exclusive to a particular chamber: (below is an example of the bicarmel [federal] legislature of the United States (USA))</li>

          <ul>
            <li>The 'House of Representatives' (lower-house) is tasked with presenting an annual spending/revenue/appropriation bill to be spend on different aspects of the country's political, economic, social, and scientific programs. They are also tasked with being the first chamber to initiate an impeachment process with a simple majority of those present (218 members, at most) in order to move the impeachment process forward.</li> 
            
            <li>Finally, if there is a tie or a lack of a majority in the 'electoral college' during a presidential election, the House members is responsible for delegating votes from each of their respective states to help elect or re-elect President of the United States.</li>

            <li>The 'Senate' (upper-house) is tasked with approving or disapproving any foreign treaty agreements that would affect the country in any way. They are also solely tasked with approving or disapproving any cabinet or judicial nominations that the executive would bring to their attention to fill in any respective vacancies for that particular position. During an impeachment process, a two-thirds majority (67 members, at most) is required to convict the defendant and remove him or her from their respective position.</li>

            <li>Finally, if there is a tie or a lack of a majority in the 'electoral college' during a presidential election, the Senate members are required to cast their votes for the position of Vice-President of the United States.</li>

          <li>This is called a <strong>semi-presidential system</strong>.

        </ul>
    </div>
    <!--    
        <p>A Parliamentary System consists of the following concepts:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>The Executive branch consists of a 'head of state' (e.g., President), a 'head of government' (e.g., 'Prime Minister,' 'Chancellor'), and members of the latter's cabinet who are members of the governing party/coalition parties. The head of state is often a different individual than the 'head of government'  with the latter usually holding more power than the former despite being in a lower position of the political hierarchy. A head of government is often a member, as well as the leader of the largest/governing party in the legislative body (e.g., 'Parliament'; 'lower house' if the legislature is "bicarmel").</li>

          <li>Depending on the country, the head of government could be [either] appointed or nominated by the head of state and/or elected with or without the approval of their respective legislature.</li>

          <li>The head of state is usually elected by popular vote on a different date than the election for the legislature.</li>

          <li>Most heads of state in a parliamentary system of government functions as a cermonial/symbolic figure with any approved bills becoming law and promulgated with or without the approval of the head of state after a certain period of time. There are, however, certain functions that certain heads of state could perform, such as providing pardons to specific individuals, command the armed/defense forces of their respective country, and being able to check the constitutionality of a bill before signing it into law (if the bill is deemed unconstitutional by the highest court in the land, the head of state could refuse to approve the bill) (specifics vary from country to country).</li>

          <li>Finally, there are a few countries with a parliamentary system that has the legislature elects the 'head of state,' who, in turn, appoints members of the cabinet.</li>

          <li>In any case that the position as 'head of state' or 'head of government' needs to be approved by a bicarmel legislature in a parliamentary system, it's always the lower house that has the [final] say.</li>
        </ul>
          
        <p>The Legislature (either unicarmel ("one house") or bicarmel ("two houses")) could consists of:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>a '<strong>lower house</strong> (e.g., 'House of Commons')' (or a single 'house' if unicarmel) that is directly elected by the electorate. The 'lower house' is the most dominant chamber of the legislature with most, if not all, bills coming from this house and the ability to pass bills without the full consent of the upper house after a certain period of time (this latter procedure is not available in all countries with a parliamentary system and specifics for this procedure varies from country to country).</li>

The same circumstances could apply to any member of the cabinet.</li>

          <li>In a parliamentary system, elections could be called for when either: (1) the head of government calls for an election on a specific date within the constitutional limit for an election or (2) the legislature votes against the government by the motion listed above or by defeating a appropriation (or budget) bill proposed by the government.

Specifics for "dissolving" the legislature varies from country to country, although the two cases listed above are the most common causes of "dissolution."</li>

          <li>All Constitutional Monarchies utilize some form of a parliamentary system with their head of state being a monarch instead of an elected presidential figure. In that case, a representative of that monarch could make the official announcement on the "dissolution" of the legislature on his/her behalf.</li>

          <li>Either way, after the "dissolution" of the legislature, the election campaign begins and the legislature would not reconvene until after a set period of time when the votes are all tallied and a government or a government coalition is officially formed (there are some instances in which the winning party is unable to either win a majority of seats in the election or form a coalition with any other parties that've won seats afterwards; hence, a party that wish to form a government without anyone else would end up forming a "Minority Government," in which the 'opposition parties' and their [respective] members outnumbers the governing party.</li>
      </ul> -->
    

    <!-- <h3>Presidential System</h3>
      <p>A Presidential System consists of the following concepts: </p>
      <ul>
        <li>The Executive branch consist of an executive (e.g., 'President') who serves as both the 'head of state' and the 'head of government' of his/her respective country. Also, depending on the specifics of a country with a presidential system, most executives would also be given the title 'commander-in-chief,' entitling them to be the 'supreme commander' of their country's armed/defense forces. The executives would often have a fixed-term in which he or she could serve their role before either running for re-election or step down if so choose. They also have term limits (at most, 1 to 3 terms) that they could serve before having to step down after the next election when a new executive is elected (specifics for both fixed-terms and term limits vary from country to country).</li>

        <li>Just like a 'head of state' in a parliamentary system, an executive in a presidential system could also pardon certain individual, depending on the circumstances that warrants a pardon. In a presidential election, an executive would have a number of cabinet members who are not members of the legislatures, but are responsible for implementing policy matters of both the executive and legislative branches based on their position within the cabinet. At the same time, most executive nominations for any position in the cabinet, judiciary, or outside executive-related (governmental) deparments requires legislative approval before the said individuals could take their posts.</li>

        <li>Unlike the head of state in a parliamentary system who serves mainly a ceremonical role in the executive branch, an executive in a presidential system have a wide assortment of powers, which includes the ability to veto a bill approved by the legislature. This veto, which could affect the entire bill or certain parts of the bill (aka "line-item veto"), could be overriden by the legislature (specifics and extent of a 'veto' vary from country to country, but the percentages vary, ranging from a simple majority (50% +1) to a two-thirds majority) within the legislative term. In most cases, a bill could become law without the approval (signature) of the executive after a certain period of time after the bill is approved by the entire legislature.</li>
      </ul>
        
        <p>The Legislature (either unicarmel ("one house") or bicarmel ("two houses")) could consists of:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>a '<strong>lower house</strong> (e.g., 'House of Representatives')' (or a single 'house' if unicarmel) that has all of its members simultaneously being elected or re-elected by 'popular vote' on a smaller 'district-based scale' at a given date during a fixed election schedule (dates vary between countries). Unlike in the parliamentary system, the lower house does not dominate the legislative process during its time in session and shares responsibility with introducing bills from either chamber.</li>

            <li>a '<strong>upper house</strong> (e.g., 'Senate')' that has a certain number of its members being elected or re-elected by 'popular vote' on a larger 'state-wide scale' during a fixed-interval election schedule (again, dates vary between countries). Unlike in the parliamentary system, the upper house does not simply function as a limited-power advisory form of a legislative body. Instead, the Senate has the ability to both introduce and pass/defeat/block bills that originates from either chamber.</li>
          </ul>
    
        <p>There is also a number of countries that combine both main systems of government: a president with broad executive power (who serves as the 'head of state') who is elected by popular vote (presidential system), as well as a prime minister (who serves as the 'head of government') and cabinet (either one of the two or both is/are appointed by the president, and may or may not need approval by the country's legislature) who are held accountable by the 'confidence' of the legislature (parliamentary system).

    <h2>Monarchy vs. Republic</h2>
      <h3>Monarchy</h3>
        <p>There are two forms of Monarchy:</p>
            <h4>Absolute Monarchy</h4>
              <ul>  
                <li>An Absolute Monarchy is a form of government that consists of a ruler who wields more executive political power/influence over their people than a constitutional or an executive monarchy, as part of their 'divine right to rule.' Their legislatures tend to be weaker in an absolute monarchy than any other forms of government in the world, as their [executive] leader tends to be in charge of any laws that he wants to be passed and enforced.</li>

                <li>Originally popular in the past, the number of absolute monarchies have shrunk considerably as a result of revolutions, cultural uprisings, and the growth of technology that greatly weakened their influences. Today, most absolute monarchies have transitioned into constitutional monarchies as a way of modernizing their standards of governance without throwing away all of their political (and historical) traditions.</li>
              </ul>

              <ul>
                <li>A Constitutional Monarchy is a form of government that consists of a monarch (king, queen, etc.) who serves as the [main] head of state, as well as the symbol [of unity] of one's own country. Most constitutional monarchies are selected through a process of hereditary succession (the process in which a member of the royal family is crowned ruler of their respective nation upon the death or abdication of the current monarch), although there are a few that have their monarchs selected by other means. Their powers, as a monarch, are limited by their country's constitution and statutes, and varies from country to country.</li>

                <li>All Constitutional Monarchies utilize some form of a parliamentary system with their head of state being a monarch instead of an elected presidential figure. In that case, a representative of that monarch could make the official announcement on the <a href="#tabs-1>#dissolution">dissolution</a> of the legislature on his/her behalf.</li>
              </ul>

            <p>There are two types of constitutional monarchs:</p>
                <h4>Ceremonial Monarchs</h4>
                  <ul>
                    <li>Ceremonial Monarchs are those who, in most circumstances, wield little political power/influence as compared to a head of government (e.g., prime minister). Hence, in most cases, any acts passed by the country's legislature is later approved (and promulgated) into law (aka 'Royal Assent') by the ceremonial monarch or by his/her representative (e.g., '<strong><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Governor-General" target="_blank">Governor-General</a></strong>') for that respective country. Some ceremonial monarchs and their respective representatives do have the power to either withhold the approval of any particular bill or reserve judgement until it's decided upon later on. In the latter case, if the judgement has not been reached, the bill would be considered void/expired or becomes law without their approval after a certain period of time (situation varies between each country). However, these powers are rarely used, as to give deference to the legislative [parliamentary] process. Most of the world's constitutional monarchies consists of ceremonial monarchs.</li>

      <h3>Republic</h3>
      <p>A Republic is a form of government that doesn't have a monarch (or any other type of royalty) as their head of state/government and involves elected officials and the citizens who've voted for them.</p>

      <p>There are three forms of a Republic:</p>
          <ol>
            <li>Parliamentary Republic - a republican-based country/territory/jurisdiction that utilizes a parliamentary system of government.</li>
            <li>Presidential Republic - a republican-based country/territory/jurisdiction that utilizes a presidential system of government.</li>
            <li>Single-Party State - an authoritarian-based country that runs it through a single-member party system with any other political parties either non-existant or under the influence of the sole dominant party. All of them are either presidential or semi-presidential republics.</li>
