#Description

This project would include an overview on a few topics related to international politics: systems of government (e.g., parliamentary vs. presidential system), unitary states vs. federations, and some of the common methods of voting for the legislative branches (e.g., 'First Past the Post (FPTP)' and 'Proportional Representation').
